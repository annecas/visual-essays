I am excited and prepared to contribute and grow as an Innovation Fellow at ITHAKA. With my extensive experience in education, customer experience, and user-centered design, I believe I would be an excellent fit for this company, its mission and this role. I have a [demonstrated passion](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annette-castro/) for designing resources that make information more accessible and engaging for diverse audiences and a flair for collaborating with others to make magic happen. As a former special education teacher with a Master’s degree for teaching exceptional learners, I am well-versed at communicating complex concepts, leveraging data, and centering user needs and interests to create, educate and inspire, so I am confident that I can bring significant insight and purpose to this role.

# I love getting creative.

My career focus has been to develop as a creative education leader, combined with my passion for the arts and humanities. With seven years in classroom and museum education, including one fully remote instructional year, I have demonstrated my consistent ability to adapt to challenges quickly while managing multiple projects and priorities effectively, as well as initiate projects that improve processes and team results. As a special education grade team lead, I led daily instruction across various subjects, managed all aspects of a classroom experience, and collected data to design individualized goals and resources in collaboration with interventionists, other teachers and parents. Under my management, struggling students significantly below grade level consistently improved their reading levels per semester, with at least 50% exceeding average grade level growth by increasing 3+ levels. Due to the service-first nature of my work, I regularly exercised sensitive judgment and creative problem-solving to meet deadlines and unexpected complications without compromising on students’ long-term goals and standards of excellence. I also chose to pursue a Master’s degree while teaching full-time, as well as learn tools on my own like Canva, Nearpod, Google Workspace features, and Figma to improve my teaching practice and expand what I could do creatively.

# I can make a positive impact.

Teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic revealed today’s challenge for educational tools and services to adequately address the ongoing learning crisis. Not only do I want to continue creating engaging content and experiences, I am ready to make a greater impact by connecting broader audiences to online resources that expand access to learning. Last fall, I took the leap to manage a legislative campaign for an education-focused candidate. Against an urgent timeline, I connected teams of volunteers, interns and political experts to deliver results while I researched and designed content to promote our mission and values across online platforms. Our campaign for a first-time candidate successfully earned 49% of the vote, achieving the most voter outreach in the state.

# I am ready to grow and contribute.

I am eager to continue doing what I love—creating compelling content with deep care for users, leveraging data to adequately address needs, and growing through authentic collaboration—by working with like-minded professionals at ITHAKA to promote access to high-quality educational content. I have seen firsthand how technology can empower students to achieve their goals and develop learner confidence, and have actually used JSTORLabs’ projects to make learning more dynamic, such as the [Interview Archive](https://labs.jstor.org/interview/mlk/) to teach about the civil rights movement. Having specialized in the humanities and arts, I am also particularly drawn to working with libraries, higher education, and other cultural institutions while gaining familiarity with application prototyping, user research, business modeling, and structured brainstorming.

I would be honored to join your team and grow ITHAKA’s initiatives. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing my qualifications and enthusiasm for ITHAKA’s work further.
